# Slack notification for NAIS teams
Send monthly notifications to Slack to keep NAIS teams up to date.

1. Fetch all teams from [NAIS API](https://github.com/nais/api).
2. For each team, send a notification to Slack to the team owners. If the team has no owners, send the notification to the Slack channel of the team.
